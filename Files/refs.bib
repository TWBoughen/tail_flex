abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.}}

abstract = {An efficient, generic and simple to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for partially observed temporal epidemic models is introduced. The algorithm is designed to be adaptive so that it can easily be used by non-experts. There are two key features incorporated in the algorithm to develop an efficient algorithm, parameter reduction and efficient, multiple updates of the augmented infection times. The algorithm is successfully applied to two real life epidemic data sets, the Abakaliki smallpox data and the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth epidemic in Cumbria.}
